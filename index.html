							<h2>About the Topic</h2>	
							<div class="pad12">
							
								<p>While the D.C. metro area is at the forefront of the housing recovery, even this market has some areas where distressed properties make up a large portion of the market. Various sources suggest that in 2011, distressed properties could make up 35 percent or more of the nation's home sales. While short sales and foreclosures aren't for everyone, buyers should understand the impact of excluding these from their shopping lists.</p>

								<p>Long &amp; Foster president and COO Jeffrey Detwiler will explore the nature of short sale transactions and why local buyers should not be afraid to engage with these properties. With the right approach and reasonable expectations, buyers of short sales could land a deal-especially when coupled with today's ideal affordability conditions. A real estate and mortgage expert, Detwiler will also present options for homeowners currently facing foreclosure, including how a short sale transaction with the lender is more advantageous in the long run than the alternative of foreclosure proceedings.</p>
								
							</div>
							
							<h2>Top Ten Questions</h2>
							<div class="pad12" id="questions">

								<div class="qa-container set1">
									<div class="question">Question 1</div>
									<p>I'll admit that I don't exactly understand what a short sale is. Can you explain it?</p>
									<div class="answer">Answer</div>
									<p>In its most basic form, a short sale is when a lender agrees to accept a payoff from a homeowner of less than what is owed on the mortgage. In the current environment, this is happening because home prices declined and some homeowners are underwater on their mortgages &mdash; meaning they owe more to the lender than what the house is worth.</p>
									<p>Usually, lenders prefer short sales to foreclosures because it means they'll likely recoup more of the money they're owed. </p>
									<p>I'll note that being upside-down on your mortgage doesn't necessarily mean you'll be eligible for a short sale. Lenders will want to see some sign of hardship &mdash; that you can no longer afford your mortgage &mdash; along with the negative equity situation you're facing. </p>						
									<p>And I'll start this Q&amp;A discussion by saying that it's imperative that you consult your legal and tax professionals regarding your personal situation. While I'm highlighting some generalities and commonalities in the current environment, your own decision to buy or sell as a short sale or foreclosure should be based on the advice of those familiar with your personal circumstances. </p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="qa-container set1">
									<div class="question">Question 2</div>
									<p>What kind of discount can a buyer expect in a short sale?</p>
									<div class="answer">Answer</div>
									<p>Generally, lenders are in the driver's seat on short sales and they aim to garner as much as they can for the property. They know they won't be receiving the full amount of what the current homeowner owes on his or her mortgage, but lenders like to receive fair market value for the home.</p>		
									<p>What this means for the buyer is that an acceptable short sale offer is generally reflective of today's current home price environment. This will be down significantly from the peak of a few years ago &mdash; you certainly aren't likely to pay what the previous homeowner did for the house.</p> 								
									<p>You may be able to get the house at a slight discount &mdash; after all, fair market value is a range. A short sale won't get a home at a deeply-discounted price, but you may find yourself at the low end of the fair market value range.</p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="qa-container set1">
									<div class="question">Question 3</div>
									<p>I'm in the market for a home and it seems that almost half of all the listings I look at online are distressed properties. How much of the market do short sales and foreclosures really make up?</p>
									<div class="answer">Answer</div>
									<p>In some areas of the greater D.C. region, short sales make up as much as 40 percent of the market &mdash; and as much as half of the available inventory in some areas. This varies greatly by market as some areas have relatively few short sales available, and others have quite a few options.</p>
									<p>This is a great opportunity for well-qualified buyers in our region. If you have the time to dedicate to a short sale transaction and realistic expectations regarding the process, you may have the option of pursuing a significant percentage of the current available inventory in your area &mdash; and perhaps walking away with an ideal purchase price on your next home.</p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="qa-container hidden set2">
									<div class="question">Question 4</div>
									<p>What are short sales and foreclosures really doing to home prices in this area?</p>
									<div class="answer">Answer</div>
									<p>The truth of the matter is that it really depends on what's happening in your local market. There are a few things that distressed properties can do to a local housing market &mdash; but the degree to which the impact is negative depends entirely on what the rest of the market looks like. If short sales are a larger percentage of the total homes sold, or if local appraisers incorporate a certain percentage of distressed assets into their data profile when completing appraisals, it can certainly impact the dynamic of the local housing market where you are.</p>
									<p>I'll say this, though, if you're tapped into what's happening in your local market &mdash; and the free neighborhood-level Long &amp; Foster Market Minute reports are a quick-and-easy way to learn about housing data in your area &mdash; you may see where distressed assets in the mix of the housing offerings can present some interesting opportunities.</p>
									<p>If you're in a position to buy a home, for example, you'll likely find that distressed assets offer you some options with pricing in your favor.</p> 
									<p>For those who are trying to refinance, distressed assets impacting housing prices can be a frustrating situation, but as we continue to work through these properties, the inventory will eventually shift back to a majority of traditional sales, and pricing will likely start a reasonable path of recalibration.</p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="qa-container hidden set2">
									<div class="question">Question 5</div>
									<p>I wanted to do a traditional purchase &mdash; I am concerned about the time and patience I'd need for a short sale &mdash; but I'm finding that the inventory of distressed sales is severely limiting my traditional choices. What do you suggest?</p>
									<div class="answer">Answer</div>
									<p>This is definitely a market dynamic buyers will face for the next few years, I believe, as we continue to work through the inventory of homes that are tied to underwater mortgages. I understand that if you're facing a relocation situation or some other reason for which time is a critical factor, you may very well want to avoid pursuing a short sale property. The time it takes to complete a short sale transaction can be unpredictable, and it varies by lender.</p>
									<p>But let me add this, and I cannot state it clearly enough &mdash; you do not necessarily need to be afraid of a short sale. The transactions are certainly complicated and they can take several months to complete, but if you have short sale experts working for you to guide you through the process, they can also offer you financial reward.</p> 
									<p>Before you rule out distressed properties in your home search, speak with a qualified Realtor who has experience in short sales. At Long &amp; Foster, we not only have some of the industry's best-trained agents specializing in these types of transactions, but we also have a short sale management company that works in tandem with our agents to bring more short sale purchases to the closing table in less time.</p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="qa-container hidden set3">
									<div class="question">Question 6</div>
									<p>I've heard that banks can be a nightmare in a short sale process. Do I stand any hope of experiencing a relatively smooth deal?</p>
									<div class="answer">Answer</div>
									<p>Well, I'll be honest with you &mdash; short sales are not for everyone. They take some patience and it helps to have an experienced Realtor and a negotiator on your side. But with some perseverance on your part and an experienced team helping you, the processes of the lenders involved might not seem so frustrating.</p>
									<p>It'll depend on the lender, but some things do make it easier. It's more difficult and lengthy to short sale an FHA loan versus a conventional loan, and it's easier to deal with one lien instead of multiple parties.</p>
									<p>I recently completed purchasing my home, which was a short sale offering. Even with my background in the mortgage industry, I relied on experts to manage my transaction. I worked with a Long &amp; Foster Realtor, of course, but we also took advantage of Long &amp; Foster's short sale management company, Platinum Group Services. Platinum specializes in managing the process and negotiating with lenders. Everyone's short sale experience can be different, but I found Platinum to be invaluable in terms of freeing up my time and making sure all follow-up items were completed. My purchase made it to the closing table ahead of what I would have expected, even with the extra requirements of it being a short sale.</p>
									<p>Lenders &mdash; no doubt &mdash; are inundated with these types of transactions to process. The National Association of Realtors notes that &mdash; on a national level &mdash; about a third of all transactions right now are distressed properties, and they expect that number to remain elevated in the near-term. And with government incentives and even the lenders themselves encouraging short sales, some banks are struggling to keep up.</p>
									<p>The good news is that better processes, use of technology and the emergence of experienced processors is speeding up the time it takes to complete a transaction in the case of most lenders.</p> 
									<p>I'll just point out that while a seller may go through a short sale process only once in their lives, Platinum Group Services deals with thousands of short sale transactions each year. The time component of a short sale isn't always the lender &mdash; the participants also need to know what paperwork is required, submit it on time and make sure it's completed correctly. Platinum is on the cutting-edge of new short sale processes and works in conjunction with all of the major financial institutions. The transaction management experts at Platinum know what every lender wants, and what will slow things down. This definitely eases the process in many cases.</p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="qa-container hidden set3">
									<div class="question">Question 7</div>
									<p>Why is going through the hassle of a short sale better for a homeowner than foreclosing or just walking away?</p>
									<div class="answer">Answer</div>
									<p>I understand that what has happened in the real estate industry in the last several years is unprecedented. Times are difficult for so many families in our area, and across the country, and it may seem like the best option is to foreclose.</p>
									<p>But I believe there will come a time in the not-too-distant future when many homeowners who are currently struggling are in a much better economic situation. Perhaps you'll get a better job or receive a promotion. Then you'll be glad you took the time to learn about your options when comparing a short sale to foreclosure</p>.
									<p>A short sale packs less of a punch on your credit, and in many cases, you'll be able to purchase your next home in as few as two or three years after completing your short sale. With a foreclosure, the waiting period could be five years, seven years or longer, depending on the lender and your personal situation.</p>
									<p>Lenders are also starting to levy judgments against sellers that remain tied to you as the seller after the deal is completed. These lenders are looking to recoup their losses. So if you foreclose, the amount you'd be required to pay back &mdash; the amount equaling the bank's loss &mdash; is likely to be much greater than if you successfully executed a short sale. Not only is a foreclosure sold for less, which means the bank will still be owed more, but there's also additional fees associated with foreclosures, such as paying for attorneys for the lenders</p>. 
									<p>Once again, I want to add that you should definitely consult your legal and tax professionals regarding your personal situation. While I'm highlighting some generalities and commonalities in the current environment, your own decision should be based on the advice of those familiar with your personal circumstances.</p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="qa-container hidden set4">
									<div class="question">Question 8</div>
									<p>Who is eligible to participate in a short sale?</p>
									<div class="answer">Answer</div>
									<p>To engage in a short sale transaction with your lender, you're going to need to prove that you're facing some sort of hardship. That doesn't mean you're late on your payments, necessarily, but you'll need to indicate to the bank why you're interested in a short sale.</p>
									<p>An experienced Realtor will be able to offer you guidance relevant to your particular situation, but in general, a hardship letter &mdash; which will likely be required for a short sale &mdash; should point out the reason behind your request. This could be a loss of a job, a pending divorce or relocation for a job. It could also be because of an illness or medical bills, or an adjustable-rate mortgage that's about to reset to a much higher interest rate.</p>
									<p>You may also be asked to show your lack of other assets available to pay for the mortgage.</p> 
									<p>The key, as I understand it, is to be as factual and concise as possible. While the reason for your request may be personal in nature, what you're requesting is a change to the terms of your contract &mdash; not an approval to not pay your mortgage.</p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="qa-container hidden set4">
									<div class="question">Question 9</div>
									<p>Are there complications in getting financing approved for a distress sale?  Any tips you could offer?</p>
									<div class="answer">Answer</div>
									<p>There can be hurdles because you're dealing with a distressed property &mdash; and not all of the hurdles are directly related to lenders and financing issues. For example, if the house has been vacant for a while, the utilities might have been shut off, which will hinder a home inspection process. If there are issues of disrepair, the seller is likely not to have the funds to repair anything, and the seller's lender won't pay for certain repairs either. If it's a repair that's necessary for health and safety reasons &mdash; like a banister that's missing or broken &mdash; you may have some luck, but you're unlikely to have success asking for that old, dirty carpet to be replaced.</p>
									<p>Your lender may not start working on your financing and underwriting until a short sale has been approved, but then there may be a rush to get underwriting completed in time for closing. It's a tricky situation that can be overcome with diligence and attention to detail &mdash; and a lot of follow-up on your part to make sure you understand how your lender is prepared to proceed with your case.</p>
									<p>Talk to your lender, but you may find that being pre-qualified for financing may help your progress with distressed properties.</p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="qa-container hidden set4">
									<div class="question">Question 10</div>
									<p>I've heard you mention PGS&hellip; what is this? What do they do?</p>
									<div class="answer">Answer</div>
									<p>Platinum Group Services is Long &amp; Foster's independent short sale management company. It was developed specifically to serve Long &amp; Foster sales associates who have clients involved with short sales.</p>
									<p>Distressed property transactions are complicated and very detail-dependent, and to make things more challenging, lenders are constantly changing their policies as they become better at managing their own internal processes. This can be tricky for a Realtor to keep up with, even if he or she specializes in short sales full time.</p>
									<p>So we offer the services of Platinum Group Services to our agents to help manage all the details that come with short sales. The short sale management experts at Platinum follow-up with all the parties involved and make sure every deadline is met. They deal with all of the major lenders on a daily basis, and are well-equipped to help short sale sellers and potential buyers reach their real estate goals.</p> 
									<p>There are many reasons that Long &amp; Foster agents can bring you the best service and expertise in the market, but if you're involved with a short sale as either a buyer or seller in particular, there's no better support system in the market than what Platinum Group Services offers Long &amp; Foster agents and their customers.</p>
